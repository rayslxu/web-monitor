This is a simple webpage monitor. My wife (girlfriend at the time I did this) wanted me to monitor a webpage to see whether there are new sunglasses. So I wrote this script.
Set the url to the webpage and the information of the target you want to monitor in the source code. Then run the script, it will play an alarm aduio file when the target changes.
